    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
        lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>new Scientist</i>,
        and all the other scientific journals her work had appeard in, 
        was well thumbed copy <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Mollys favourite book 
        since collage.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under
        a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
        <q>Work is the refuge of people who nothing better to do</q>.
        Although of the <abbr title="secrets">discovering space secrets.</abbr> 
        Molly <em>had</em> lamb.
